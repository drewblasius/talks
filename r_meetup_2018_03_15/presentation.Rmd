```

## CHRW Data Science

- Small group, focused on rapid prototyping
- Many ideas will "die on the vine"
- Need to interface with domain layer often to gain insights
- Need for code that can be quickly moved from notebook -> prototype -> production

## Why R?

- Most of us are Statisticians/Mathematicians by trade => package availability
- Tools for Exploratory Data Analysis
- Concise
- Extremely good at handling tabular data (`data.table`!)
- Connectors exist for commonly used databases in prototyping (Redis, Mongo, etc.)

## Tools 

### Understanding Data + Model Building
- `GGally` 
- `trelliscopejs`
- `XGBoost` + `ICEBox` + `PDP`

### Prototyping
- docker 
- docker-compose
- `plumber`
